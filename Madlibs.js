// Ronald wanted, no, needed to get that MacGuffin. He needed it so bad that if he didn’t get it, he’ll turn red.
// He plants his foot into the ground, with a determined mindset. Jumping into his grey car, he flicks a switch and is launched out.
// It made him very angry. Instead, he runs down the road to smash a window. into a house. Ronald steals a pencil from the table and dashes onto the road.
// He bends over to write on the ground that he is peaceful. Suddenly, he gets kicked in the head. He’s having a very bad day. Ronald has had enough.
// He will get that MacGuffin no matter the cost. Using nothing but his feet, he walks calmly down the road once more. He powers through all the rocks thrown
// at him and reaches the MacGuffin on the stump. When he grabs at it, a powerful shudder runs through his body. He’s finally done it! He finally has the almighty golden stick.
// Laughing, he turns around and points it at a bush. Then someone plucks it out of his hand and tosses it into the trashcan.
